## Problem Statement

Banks face significant challenges in commercial lending:

- **Delayed Risk Detection**: Traditional methods often identify problems after significant financial deterioration
- **Static Risk Models**: Many systems fail to capture evolving client behavior patterns
- **Data Utilization Gaps**: Valuable insights from transaction patterns remain untapped
- **False Positives**: Excessive alerts lead to relationship manager fatigue and missed genuine risks
- **Persona Transition Blindness**: Inability to track how client behavior evolves toward higher risk states

These issues contribute to suboptimal loan performance, inefficient capital allocation, and missed opportunities for early intervention.
