Why it matters: Helps quantify the financial risk to the bank's portfolio.

Example: In a trade war scenario, loans to companies in targeted industries (e.g., Tech, Automotive) are highlighted.

Data Needed: Loan amounts, industry classifications, and geographic locations.

Regional Exposure Distribution:

What it measures: The geographic concentration of at-risk loans.

Why it matters: Identifies regions with the highest exposure, enabling targeted risk mitigation.

Example: In an earthquake scenario, loans in California and Tokyo are flagged.

Data Needed: State/country-level loan distribution data.

Industry Concentration:

What it measures: The distribution of at-risk loans across industries.

Why it matters: Highlights sectors most vulnerable to the crisis.

Example: In a financial attack, the Finance and Tech sectors may show higher vulnerability.

Data Needed: Industry classification of borrowers.

2. Loss Projections
Base vs Worst-Case Scenarios:

What it measures: Projected losses under different severity levels.

Why it matters: Prepares the bank for a range of outcomes.

Example: A flood scenario may have a base loss of 

Data Needed: Historical loss data, crisis severity parameters.

Risk Rating-Based Loss Estimates:

What it measures: Expected losses segmented by risk ratings (Low, Medium, High).

Why it matters: Helps prioritize high-risk loans for immediate action.

Example: High-risk loans may account for 60% of total projected losses.

Data Needed: Risk ratings of borrowers, historical default rates.

Capital Adequacy Impact:

What it measures: The effect of projected losses on the bank's capital reserves.

Why it matters: Ensures the bank remains compliant with regulatory requirements.

Example: A $200M loss may reduce the capital adequacy ratio by 1.5%.

Data Needed: Capital reserves, regulatory thresholds.

3. Risk Intelligence

Why it matters: Proactively identifies outliers before they escalate.

Example: A company with unusually high exposure to a crisis-prone region.

Data Needed: Loan exposure data, historical anomaly patterns.

Historical Crisis Pattern Matching:

What it measures: Similarities between the current crisis and past events.

Why it matters: Leverages historical data to predict outcomes.

Example: A trade war scenario may resemble the 2018 US-China trade conflict.

Data Needed: Historical crisis data, economic indicators.

Vulnerability Scores by Counterparty:

What it measures: A risk score for each borrower based on their exposure and resilience.

Why it matters: Helps prioritize mitigation efforts.

Example: A Tech company in California may have a vulnerability score of 0.8 (high risk).

Data Needed: Financial health data, crisis exposure metrics.

4. Mitigation Metrics
Potential Recovery Rates:

What it measures: The percentage of losses that can be recovered.

Why it matters: Provides a more accurate picture of net losses.

Example: Insurance may cover 40% of losses in a natural disaster.

Data Needed: Insurance coverage data, historical recovery rates.

Insurance Coverage Gaps:

What it measures: The portion of losses not covered by insurance.

Why it matters: Identifies areas where additional coverage is needed.

Example: 
100Mlosswithonly60M in insurance coverage leaves a $40M gap.

Data Needed: Insurance policy details, loan exposure data.

Liquidity Impact Analysis:

What it measures: The effect of the crisis on the bank's liquidity position.
