Integrated Bank Client Risk Analysis with Credit Score Backtest

I've created a comprehensive end-to-end solution that integrates your original bank client risk analysis framework with a new credit score backtest component. This integration allows you to validate how well your persona-based risk detection system predicts actual credit downgrades.

## How the Solution Works

The integrated solution consists of two main phases:

### Phase 1: Bank Client Risk Analysis

This phase uses your original algorithm to:
1. Clean and process bank client transaction data
2. Calculate derived metrics including loan utilization and deposit patterns
3. Detect risk patterns using sophisticated rules
4. Assign risk personas to clients based on their behavior
5. Track persona transitions and identify high-risk clients

### Phase 2: Credit Score Backtest

This new phase validates the predictive power of your personas by:
1. Analyzing actual credit score downgrades
2. Measuring how often risky personas are assigned prior to downgrades
3. Calculating the lead time between persona assignments and downgrades
4. Evaluating performance across different industries and downgrade severities
5. Determining which personas are most effective at predicting credit deterioration

## Key Features of the Integration

### Dynamic Lead Time Analysis

The system calculates how many days before a credit downgrade each persona was assigned, allowing you to identify which personas provide the earliest warning signals.

### Severity-Based Performance

The solution analyzes whether more severe downgrades (larger drops in credit rating) are detected earlier, helping prioritize intervention for the highest-risk clients.

### Industry-Specific Validation

Performance metrics are broken down by industry, revealing which sectors your risk detection model works best for and where it needs improvement.

### Confidence Impact Assessment

The backtest evaluates how persona confidence levels affect prediction accuracy, enabling you to set optimal confidence thresholds.

## Practical Business Applications

1. **Risk Model Refinement**: You can identify which personas are truly predictive of credit deterioration and refine your risk detection rules accordingly.

2. **Early Intervention Optimization**: Understanding the typical lead time before downgrades helps calibrate when to initiate client interventions.

3. **Industry-Specific Strategies**: Tailor your approach based on where your model performs best or needs improvement across different sectors.

4. **Risk Team Focus**: Prioritize attention on personas with the highest predictive power for severe downgrades
