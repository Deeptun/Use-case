Use case

In corporate credit risk modeling, default events are rare compared to non-defaults, leading to a severe class imbalance.

Traditional loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy) may not give enough weight to minority class instances, resulting in a biased model.

Focal loss helps by down-weighting easy-to-classify samples and focusing on hard-to-classify minority class instances (defaults).



2. Reducing Overconfidence in Predictions:

Standard models often yield overconfident predictions in imbalanced settings.

Focal loss adjusts probability distributions, making the model more reliable in risk assessment.



3. Improving Recall without Sacrificing Precision:

In corporate lending, missing a potential defaulter is riskier than incorrectly flagging a non-defaulter.

Focal loss ensures that the model pays more attention to difficult-to-classify defaulters while maintaining precision.



4. Better Handling of Noisy Data:

Corporate financials, credit history, and macroeconomic conditions introduce noise in credit risk models.
